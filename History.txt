=== 3.0.3 / 2011-02-06
* Compatible with Rails 3 (tested against Rails 3.0.3 in particular)
* Changing version numbering to match Rails version tested against.

=== 0.1.6 / 2009-02-20
* Fixed bugs so tests actually pass in Rails 2.2.2.  Erroneously tested against 2.1.2 for release 0.1.5.

=== 0.1.5 / 2009-02-19
* Fixed bug 23868 - now works with Rails 2.2 - http://rubyforge.org/tracker/?atid=23868&group_id=6158&func=browse
* Added default_sorter as an option instead of creating a yaml file.  Also able to generate default yaml output using 
  ModelName.default_col_defs

=== 0.1.4 / 2008-06-04
* Table heading (TH) urls now remove any parameter named "page". This is to support paginated tables
  since, if a user is on a page other than 1, clicking on a column heading should sort all data and 
  revert back to page 1.
* Changed self.#{sorter_name}_col_text to return non-breaking space when nil or empty string.  
  (this is to force TD elements to be displayed when empty)

=== 0.1.3 / 2008-05-05
* Minor test updates, doc updates

=== 0.1.2 / 2008-05-01

* Added date and datetime formats for columns
* Added ability to supply attributes as extra url parameters

=== 0.1.1 / 2008-04-29
